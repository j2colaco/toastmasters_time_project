# This is Our Time

## 1.0 Purpose
UHN Toastmasters club has been rewarded with the president distinction for 10 years in a row. However, the club has  a lot to improve in terms of time management. In October 2019, members noticed a lot of meetings/speakers/speech evaluators go over time. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to keep Toastmaster meetings on time (as close to agenda timings). This will be done by identifying the club’s problem points in terms of time management, analyzing root causes of the issues and implementing effective solutions. In order to keep UHN Toastmasters meetings on time, all members must be mindful of time and work as a team to keep every meeting on schedule.

### 1.1 Terms
Before looking at the results, it is important to understand frequent terms or language that will be used in this report. The following list contains terms and their definitions:

- Meeting sections: Data was collected for individual speaker roles and meeting sections. A meeting section is a group of speaker roles. The toastmaster meeting is divided into eight meeting sections. Below is a list of the eight meeting sections and the roles included in the section:
  - Meeting Opening
  - Sergeant at Arms (SAA)
  - Introduce Guest and Theme
    - TME introduces the theme
    - Guest introductions
  - Evaluation Introduction
    - General evaluator role introduction
    - Ah counter role introduction
    - Grammarian role introduction
    - Timer role introduction 
  - Speech Program
    - All speeches during the meeting: Speaker 1-3
  - Table Topics
    - Table topic master introduction
    - All table topics during the meeting
  - Break
  - Evaluation
    - All speech evaluation reports
    - Ah counter report
    - Grammarian report
    - Timer report
    - General evaluator report
  - Club Business
  - Comments/Announcements
- Allotted time: Allotted time is the amount of time allotted to the speaker. This can normally be found on the agenda. It is known that a speech is usually 5-7 minutes. However, after the maximum allotted time, the speaker is still allowed a buffer of 30 seconds to wrap the speech. If a speech has a maximum allotted time of  7 minutes, the speaker is allowed to speak till 7 minutes and 30 seconds. This goes for all speaker roles with an allotted time. 
- Actual time: This is the actual time the speaker delivered a speech for their respective role.
- Buffer time: This is additional time allotted to meeting sections. For example, if a speech is 7 minutes long, the speaker is allowed to go 30 seconds over or under. That 30 second window is buffer time.
- Speaker: Any individual speaker role. For example, each time a member or guest speaks for table topic, speech or evaluation is a speaker role. Guest introductions & comments and any club business speaker is not seen as speaker roles. However, these times are accounted for in the meeting section timings. 

## 2.0 Plan
The plan is divided into the following three parts:
### 2.1: Data Collection
Data was collected for five consecutive meetings. All speaker roles were timed with the except of few noted in the list below:
- Timer: The timer is not timed during their introduction at the beginning of the meeting or the timer report during the end of the meeting. However, the “Evaluation Introduction” and the “Evaluation” meeting section times includes the timer role speaking time.
- Sergeant at Arms: This role is not timed and is not included in any of the meeting section times.
- Club Business speakers: Individual speakers are not timed during this meeting section. The meetings section as a whole is timed.
- Guest Introductions and Ending Comments: Individual guests are not time during their introduction or ending remarks. However, all the guest comments are timed as a whole in the meeting section times.

There was also an effort to capture opinions of UHN Toastmasters members. Here is a doc summarizing UHN member opinions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qImSyN64IDnACFHW5btC_LwrPolVMg11Z_fnsEFBl6c/edit?usp=sharing.

All of the data for this project is located here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ez167yT8dTaoB-LYo3KSM-TGOj1FkFjcMhRZfns51dE/edit?usp=sharing.

### 2.2: Data Analysis
After the data was collected, it was manually inputted into a google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ez167yT8dTaoB-LYo3KSM-TGOj1FkFjcMhRZfns51dE/edit?usp=sharing). The data was then cleaned and analyzed. The results of the analytics are present in the Data Analytics Results section of the document. 

## 3.0 Data Analytics Results
### 3.1 Meeting Start and End Time Stats 
Let's get into the results! Remember that all these data points are based data collection from 5 UHN Toastmaster meetings.
#### 3.1.1 Duration of Meetings
Based on the agenda, our meetings should start at 6:10pm and end at 7:55pm. Thus, the allotted meeting duration is 1 hour and 45 minutes. UHN Toastmaster meetings are consistent with the agenda meeting duration as the average actual meeting duration is 1 hour and 44 minutes.

| Stats Over 5 Meetings | Duration (hr:min) |
| --- | --- |
| Min | 1:38 |
| Mean | 1:44  |
| Max | 1:52 |

Conclusion: UHN Toastmaster meeting duration is consistent with agenda timings. If this is the case, then does  UHN Toastmasters have a problem with time management of speaker roles?
#### 3.1.2 Meeting Start and Ending Time
Out of 5 meetings, 3 started after 6:10pm. However, if a buffer of 5 minutes is allowed (meetings start between 6:05-6:15pm), all of the 5 UHN Toastmaster meetings start on-time! If the same logic is used for meeting ending time (meeting ends between 7:50-8:00pm), 4 meetings ended on-time and one meeting ended late; 8:03pm.

| --- | Without Any Buffer | With 5 minute Buffer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Count Meetings Started On-Time | 3 | 5 |
| Count Meetings Ended On-Time | 3 | 4 |

Conclusion: UHN Toastmaster meetings generally start and end on-time. If this is the case, then does  UHN Toastmasters have a problem with time management of speaker roles?
## 4.0 Overall Speaker Role Stats
Total number of individual speaker roles over five meetings is 118. Out of these 118 roles, 83 roles have an allotted time. Examples of some roles that do not have allotted times are Timer, Grammarian, Ah Counter and so on. Out of these 83 individual speaker roles with allotted time, 23 speakers went over time (~28%). Given the buffer of 30 seconds after max allotted time, 15 out of 83 speakers went over time (~18%).

Here is a summary of the meeting sections where speakers went over time:

| Meeting Section | Number of Speakers Over-Time | Number of Speakers more than 30 Seconds Over-Time | Percent of Total Speakers Over 5 meetings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Speech Program | 10 | 9 | ~67% |
| Table Topics | 2 | 0 | ~5% |
| Evaluation | 11 | 6 | ~73% |

Conclusion: Majority of the speakers during the “Speech Program” and “Evaluation” meeting section are going over the allotted time.
## 5.0 Overall Meeting Section Stats

| Meeting Section | Allotted Section Time (minutes) | Average Actual Section Time (minutes) | Average Section Time/Allotted Section Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluation | 15.0 | 20.53 | 138% |
| Break | 5.0 | 6.82 | 136% |
| Introduce Guest and Theme | 5.0 | 6.59 | 132% |
| Evaluation Introduction | 5.0 | 5.31 | 106% |
| Speech Program | 30.0 | 31.24 | 104% |
| Table Topics | 20.0 | 17.54 | 88% |
| Club Business | 10.0 | 3.65 | 36% |
| Comments/Announcements | 10.0 | 3.46 | 35%|

The table above shows the allotted time and average actual time for each meeting section. For  example, the “Evaluation” meeting section has an allotted time of 15 minutes, however, it takes an average duration of ~20 minutes in reality. This is due to the lack of buffer time in the meeting section. For instance, assuming Timer, Grammarian and Ah Counter reports are 1 minute each and all four evaluators speak for 3 minutes, that automatically adds up to 15 minutes. There is no room for  the 30 second buffer if an evaluator goes over 3 minute as an example.

Evaluation Section Time: 3*3mins (speech evaluators) + 3*1mins (Timer, Gramarrian, Ah Counter) + 1*3mins (General Evaluator) = 15 minutes

The “Break” meeting section went over 5 minutes in all five meetings which may indicate that it is too short of an allotted time period. “Evaluation”, “Break” and “Introduce Guest and Theme” are consistently going over time.

Furthermore, it is interesting to note that 67% of “Speech Program” speakers went over-time in five meetings, however, the overall average “Speech  Program” time is only ~1 minute over the allotted section time. This is due to lots of buffer time. For example, if there are three 7 minute speeches, (7+2)*3 + = 27 which leaves 3 minutes of buffer time for the Toastmaster of the evening to introduce the speakers.

UHN Toastmasters manages the “Table Topics” meeting section very well in terms of time. This is likely due to the excitement for a quick break! However, during the data collection process, Table Topics would often end later than 7:15pm (when  break starts) as the Table Topics Master needs to recap list of members/guests who spoke during the section. This causes the meeting to run late.

It is important to note that the “Meeting Opening” section led by the Sergeant at Arms is an under-untilized section with an allotted time of 5 minutes. The “Introduce Guest and Theme” section utilizes some of the time from the “Meeting Opening” section, which shadows the latter section from constantly going over allotted time without capturing data.

“Club Business” and “Comments/Announcements” section have under-utilized allotted time over the data collection period. This under-utilized time can be called our make-up time as all five meetings were running behind schedule until the meeting came to these sections. This may result in members feeling like the schedule times do not matter as much as it can always be made up. 

Conclusion: Need to perform analysis for “Evaluation”, “Break” and “Introduce Guest and Theme” sections as they are consistently going over time. “Break” meeting section is too short of an allotted time based on time studies. UHN Toastmasters meetings have a make- up section which does not reflect real world situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
### 5.1 Evaluation
| Meeting Section | Speaker Role | Total Number of Speakers Over 5 Meetings | Number of Speakers Over-Time | Average Actual Speaker Minutes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluation | Ah Counter Report | 5 | Not timed | 0.84 |
| Evaluation | Grammarian Report | 5 | Not timed | 2.16 |
| Evaluation | General Evaluator Report | 5 | Not timed | 3.45 |
| Evaluation | Speech Evaluator | 15 | 11 (~73%) | 3.34 |

Out of all the roles in the “Evaluation” meeting section, only the speech evaluator role is timed. Majority of speech evaluators go over-time which is causing the entire section to go over-time. However, it is important to note the General Evaluators on average speak for ~3:30 minutes (ideally this would be 2-3 minutes).

Due to the lack of buffer time in this section, there is no room for error. Minor issues that occur during this meeting section can cause it to go over the allotted time. An example of a minor issue is the Ah Counter is not ready to give their report as the member needs more time to sum up all the counts.

*Side Note: Switch Ah Counter with Grammarian on agenda to allow time for the Ah Counter to get the counts of stop words.

Conclusion: Explore the possibility of setting an allotted time for General Evaluators to a maximum of 3 minutes and encourage speech evaluators to be mindful of time. Adding buffer time to this section is another possible solution (“Speech Program” has 3 minutes).
### 5.2 Introduce Guest and Theme
| Meeting Section | Role Name | Average speaker minutes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduce Guest and Theme | TME Theme Introduction | 4.0 |
| Introduce Guest and Theme | Guest Introductions | 2.5 |

The Toastmaster takes 4 minutes on average to introduce the theme of the meeting. This is an important part of the meeting as it sets the tone for the rest of the evening. 5 minutes may be too short of an allotted time to introduce the theme and guests. The section consistently goes ~1.5 minutes over the allotted time.

The guest introductions average time of 2.5 minutes may not be reflective of reality due to the low number of guests during the winter season.

Conclusion: This section often goes over time and is hard to keep under control due to the variability of total guests per meeting. Explore the possibility of adding buffer time due to the variability and set expectations for how long the theme introduction should take.
### 5.3 Evaluation Introduction

| Meeting Section | Role Name | Average speaker minutes | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluation Introduction | Ah Counter role | 0.82 |
| Evaluation Introduction | Grammarian role | 2.1 |

From the table above, it seems Grammarians have a lot to talk about as it takes them 260% more time to introduce their roles than the Ah Counter. This is true because Grammarians have to introduce the role, word of the day (WOD) with examples, and a reminder to knock on wood when the WOD is heard. Ah Counter role is introduced in less than a minute on average.

Introducing 4 roles in the section within 5 minutes is tough. Thus, this section goes slightly overtime as shown in Overall Meeting Section Stats.

Conclusion: Add some buffer time into this section. Possibly set expectations for how long it should take to introduce roles.
### 5.4 Speech Program

| Role | Maximum Allotted Time | Count Speeches | # Speeches Over Allotted Time | # Speeches 30s Over Allotted Time | Average Actual Speech Time (minutes)|
| --- | ---| --- | --- | ---| --- |
| Speaker | 4.0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | -  |
| Speaker | 6.0 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 6.15 |
| Speaker | 7.0 | 9 | 6 | 6 | 7.65 |
| Speaker | 8.0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | - |

Majority of Toastmaster speeches have a maximum allotted time of 6 (ice breakers) or 7 minutes. Out of the 9 speeches that had an allotted time of 7 minutes, six of them were overtime. That is 78%. For the five meetings, 67% of the speeches were overtime in this meeting section. This is clear evidence that speakers are consistently overtime.

Conclusion: UHN Toastmasters speakers have a proven tendency to go overtime. Need to explore tactics to help keep speakers on-time without diminishing the value/content of the speech.
## 6.0 Problem Highlights
Even though UHN Toastmasters meetings start and end on time, speakers still have a tendency to go over allotted times for roles. Members usually take comfort in knowing that the time can always be made up towards the end of the meeting which is part of the problem. Re-organizing some of the agenda timings along with setting guiding expectations for roles during the meeting will help the club learn to work as a team to keep meetings on time.  Below is a list of problem points:

- 30% of speaking roles during the meeting do not have allotted times or set expectations of time for that role. Eg General Evaluator, Timer, Ah Counter, Grammarian, and Toastmaster of the Evening.
- 28% of speakers go over the allotted time for their speeches, evaluations and/or table topics. 
- 10 out of 15 speeches during the "Speech Program" meeting section went over the allotted time. 
- 11 out of 15 speech evaluations during the "Evaluation" meeting section went over the allotted time. 
- "Introduce Guest and Theme", "Evaluation Introduction", "Break" and "Evaluation" meeting sections do not have enough buffer time. 
- "Club Business" and "Comments/Announcements" sections allotted times are under-utilized and could be the sole reason members do not use agenda scheduled times as priority as time can be made up in these sections
- “Meeting Opening” section is an under-utilized section as well. “Introduce Theme and Guests” generally makes use of some of the leftover time to keep the meeting on schedule.
- Hypothesis: some members may not care about the time management aspect of their speech or are not aware of the benefit of it.
## 7.0 List of Suggested Improvements
The list consists of re-ordering  some of the agenda timings/roles and setting expectations for certain roles:
- Add some buffer time to the "Introduce Guest and Theme" and  "Evaluation Introduction" sections from the “Meeting Opening” section.
- Add some buffer time to the “Break” and “Evaluation” section from the “Club Business” and “Comments/Announcements” section.
- Inform speech evaluators that time of speakers speech can be a topic. If a speaker's speech was too short or long, they can provide insight into what aspects can be added or removed from the speech.
- Set expectations for timer to hold time cards up higher and/or make eye contact with timer before lowering time cards to the table. Keep waving the card if over the allotted time.
- Set expectations (on the agenda or by other means) for timings for roles such as theme introduction, General Evaluator,  Timer, Grammarian and Ah Counter. 
- Get rid of the theme of the meeting or make it optional and set expectations for the time of theme introduction
- Advise Table Topics Master to summarize list of participating members 1-2 minutes before 7:15pm (current end-time of section) instead of asking one more guest to participate.
- Use the clap down technique (initiated by the timer) to “force” speakers off the stage. Members can opt in to this component.
